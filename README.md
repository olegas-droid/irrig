Smart Irrigation Logic:

PHASE 1 → CLIMB to target moisture after overnight dryback
PHASE 2 → MAINTAIN target moisture with controlled drybacks
PHASE 3 → RESPECT plant rest periods and allow natural dryback
EMERGENCY → Save plants from critical stress (bypasses all phases)
TRACKING → Monitor water efficiency and daily consumption
